        <h2>The Case Study: Splitwise and the “Who Paid?” Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Analyzing <strong>Splitwise</strong> not just as an app, but as a
          <strong>social coordination system</strong> where interaction design
          decisions have <strong>emotional consequences</strong>. This isn’t
          just about money—our social relationships are mediated by technology.
          The “Who Paid?” problem appears when it is unclear who has paid, who
          owes what, or whose turn it is to act. Poor design widens the Gulf of
          Evaluation (users cannot easily perceive or interpret the state) and
          can cause friction, doubt, and conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Design intent (THINK before sketching):</strong> Before
          designing screens, we consider the user’s action cycle and the social
          context. Norman’s seven stages—Goal → Plan → Specify → Execute →
          Perceive → Interpret → Compare—help us see where design can fail when
          “who paid?” is ambiguous.
        </p>

        <h2>Scenarios Where “Who Paid?” Causes Trouble</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Friends “forgot” to pay</strong> — Was it a slip, or did the
            system never make “who has paid” visible? Without clear feedback and
            visible state, people cannot reliably compare outcome to goal; trust
            suffers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Trip where one person paid for everything, then chaos
              ensued</strong
            >
            — One user executed many payments; others cannot easily perceive
            what was paid, interpret who owes whom, or compare against their
            mental model. The Gulf of Evaluation is wide; settling up becomes
            emotionally loaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong
              >Group dinner where the bill split took longer than the
              meal</strong
            >
            — The task (split the bill, record who paid, who owes what) has a
            complex Plan and Specify; without a clear method and visible state,
            execution and evaluation drag on. GOMS and KLM help analyse the
            efficiency of the task; Norman explains the emotional cost when
            evaluation is hard.

        <h2>Analysing with Norman and GOMS</h2>
        <p>
          Below we analyse the “who paid?” situation in the same way as the
          Automatic Syringe:
          <strong>without clear design support</strong> (chaos, ambiguity) vs
          <strong
            >with design that supports visibility and coordination.
          </strong>
          The purpose is to clearly communicate how
          <strong>Norman’s model</strong> and <strong>GOMS</strong> give
          different but complementary views of the same problem (Lab 01).

          Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation
          <span class="citation">(Dix et al., Ch. 3, pp. 126–127)</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Gulf of Execution:</strong> When “who paid?” is not supported
          by the design, the gap between the user’s goal (record payment, get
          repaid) and the actions available is wide—there may be no clear
          “record payment” action, or it may be buried. With a design like
          Splitwise, the gulf narrows: dedicated actions (add expense, I paid,
          split) map clearly to the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gulf of Evaluation:</strong> When the system (or the social
          situation) does not make “who paid” and “who owes what” visible, the
          Gulf of Evaluation is wide—users cannot easily perceive or interpret
          the state, so they cannot reliably compare outcome to goal. Feelings
          like “friends forgot to pay” or “chaos after the trip” often stem from
          this. Good design makes state and attribution visible (who paid,
          balances), narrowing the gulf and reducing emotional friction.
