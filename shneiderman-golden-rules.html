      <h2>From Calculator to Controller: A Case Study</h2>
      <p>
        This page applies <strong>Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules for interface design</strong> (Dix et al., Ch. 7, pp. 282–283) to the
        <strong>Automatic Syringe</strong> case (dose 1372) from Dix et al., HCI 3rd ed., p. 8. We compare the <strong>“Before” calculator model</strong>
        (numeric keypad) and the <strong>“After” tuning model</strong> (digit-by-digit increment/decrement).
      </p>
      <p>
        The graphic below summarises key issues and improvements. It is consistent with Figure 0.1 in the HCI book and highlights
        how redesigning the input from a free numeric keypad to a constrained controller supports many of Schneiderman’s rules.

      <h2>Eight Golden Rules vs. Automatic Syringe Interfaces</h2>
      <p>
        For each rule, the table shows how the <strong>“Before” calculator design</strong> violates or weakly supports it, and how the
        <strong>“After” tuning design</strong> better satisfies the rule. This complements the Norman / GOMS / KLM analysis by focusing
        on concrete design guidelines
      </p>

      <table border="1">
        <caption>Schneiderman’s Eight Golden Rules for the Automatic Syringe (Before vs After)</caption>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Rule</th>
            <th scope="col">“Before” – Calculator model (keypad)</th>
            <th scope="col">“After” – Tuning model (digit-by-digit)</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <th scope="row">1. Strive for consistency</th>
            <td>
              Layout and behaviour mimic a generic calculator, not a medical controller. The same keypad patterns might mean “calculate”
              in one context and “deliver dose” in another. There is little alignment with domain expectations (dose setting).
            </td>
            <td>
              Interface is consistent with the concept of <strong>per-digit tuning</strong>. Each digit column behaves the same way
              (+ increases, − decreases); interaction is consistent across digits and matches the mental model of setting each digit.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">2. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts</th>
            <td>
              Numeric entry is fast, but <strong>unsafe shortcuts</strong> dominate: experts may type quickly and become vulnerable to
              slips with huge consequences (e.g. 13672 vs 1372). There are no safe expert shortcuts beyond raw speed.
            </td>
            <td>
              Frequent users can develop efficient patterns (e.g. starting from a typical default dose, adjusting only one or two digits).
              Although more button presses are needed, the interaction supports <strong>safe routines</strong> rather than dangerous shortcuts.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">3. Offer informative feedback</th>
            <td>
              Feedback is a <strong>single number</strong> on the display. It does not draw attention to which digit changed or indicate that
              an extra key was pressed. A slip can go unnoticed; feedback is minimal and not informative about potential error.
            </td>
            <td>
              Each button press updates one digit, so the user receives immediate, <stronggranular feedback</strong> about which part of
              the dose changed. The design can also be extended with warnings and confirmation (as in the graphic) to make feedback
              more informative (e.g. high-dose warning).
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">4. Design dialogs to yield closure</th>
            <td>
              The keypad design behaves like an open-ended calculator: after entering digits, there is no strong sense of “dose set”
              versus “still editing”. Closure depends on the user’s own judgement; the dialog lacks a clear final step.
            </td>
            <td>
              The tuning model naturally suggests a <strong>final review</strong> step: adjust each digit, then confirm that the four-digit
              value is correct. Combined with an explicit “commit” action (e.g. physical lever or confirm button), the interaction can
              provide strong closure (“dose 1372 confirmed”).
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">5. Offer simple error handling / prevent errors</th>
            <td>
              A single slip can put the dose out by a factor of 10. There are no physical or logical constraints to <strong>prevent</strong>
              such errors, and no simple way to detect or correct them. This violates the spirit of “prevent errors whenever possible.”
            </td>
            <td>
              The tuning model <strong>prevents large errors</strong> by constraining input: each action changes one digit by one step.
              Even if an error occurs, it affects only one digit, and is easy to reverse (press the opposite button). Error handling
              becomes simple and local, aligning with the rule.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">6. Permit easy reversal of actions</th>
            <td>
              Reversing a wrong keypad entry often means <strong>starting over</strong> (clear display, re-type full number). There is no
              per-digit undo and no obvious “step back” mechanism.
            </td>
            <td>
              Each step (pressing + or −) is easily reversed by pressing the opposite button. Users can “tune” the dose up and down
              without losing all progress. The interaction naturally supports local, reversible actions.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">7. Support internal locus of control</th>
            <td>
              Users may feel that the device is fragile or unpredictable: a tiny slip can have enormous consequences, so the system
              feels as if it might “betray” them. This undermines the user’s sense of control.
            </td>
            <td>
              By bounding each action and making changes visible and reversible, the tuning model helps users feel that <strong>they</strong>
              are in control of the syringe, not the other way around. Users can approach dose setting with more confidence.
            </td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <th scope="row">8. Reduce short-term memory load</th>
            <td>
              Users must keep the full target dose (e.g. 1–3–7–2) and any partial entry in mind while typing. There is no structure to
              help remember which digits are correct or which ones were just entered.
            </td>
            <td>
              The four-digit display and per-digit controls <strong>externalise memory</strong>: users can see which digits are correct and
              focus attention on the one being tuned. This reduces short-term memory load and supports accurate checking.
            </td>
