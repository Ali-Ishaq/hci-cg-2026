        <h2>The Problem (Dix et al., HCI 3rd ed., p. 8 – Figure 0.1)</h2>
        <p>
          A <strong>mechanical syringe</strong> was being developed and a
          prototype was demonstrated to hospital staff. They quickly noticed a
          <strong>potentially fatal flaw</strong> in its interface. The task is
          <strong>setting the dose to 1372</strong>. The book compares two
          interfaces: <strong>before</strong> and <strong>after</strong> user
          involvement (Dix et al., Design Focus “Quick fixes”; Figure 0.1).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Before consulting users:</strong> Doses were entered via a
            <strong>numeric keypad</strong> (like a telephone or calculator).
            One accidental keypress and the dose could be
            <strong>out by a factor of 10</strong>. For example, a slip could
            produce 13672 instead of 1372.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>After consulting users:</strong> The production version had
            <strong
              >individual increment/decrement buttons for each digit</strong
            >
            (four columns, each with + and −). A mistake then affects at most
            one digit by one unit, not the whole number (more about
            participatory design in Chapter 13; Dix et al.).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The lesson:
          <strong>Think “user”, try it out, involve the users, iterate.</strong>
          Involving actual users (hospital staff) made the fatal flaw visible
          and led to a safer design.

          <strong>differences between Norman’s model, GOMS, and KLM</strong>.
          Below, the same task (set dose to 1372) is analysed in all three

          Gulf of Execution and Gulf of Evaluation
          <span class="citation">(Dix et al., Ch. 3, pp. 126–127)</span>
        </h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Gulf of Execution</strong> is the gap between the user’s goal
          and the actions the system allows. With the <strong>keypad</strong>,
          the gulf is wide: the user can easily form the wrong intention (e.g.
          press 6 instead of 7) or make a motor slip (extra key), and the system
          does not constrain or correct—one slip can put the dose out by a
          factor of 10. With <strong>increment/decrement</strong>, the gulf is
          narrower: the interface only allows small steps per digit, so large
          errors are much harder to make.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gulf of Evaluation</strong> is the gap between the system’s
          state and what the user can perceive and interpret. With the
          <strong>keypad</strong>, the gulf is wide: a wrong number (e.g. 13672)
          can look plausible; the user may not detect the error before it is too
          late. With <strong>increment/decrement</strong>, the gulf is narrower:
          each digit is adjusted and visible separately, so mismatches between
          goal and display are easier to detect. Norman’s model thus explains
          why involving users led to a design that narrows both gulfs.

                <strong>GOMS</strong> shows the method structure (few operators,
                high error impact). <strong>KLM</strong> predicts the keypad is
                faster in error-free execution but does not explain the fatal
                flaw; that requires Norman’s evaluation side and the real-world
                consequence of a slip.

                KLM predicts the increment/decrement design is slower in expert,
                error-free time. The reason to prefer it is safety (Norman:
                narrower gulfs; GOMS: each operator has bounded effect), not
                speed.

                operators → slower. KLM does not predict the fatal flaw; it only
                predicts time. The design choice (involve users, iterate) is
                justified by Norman and by the real-world consequence of slips,
                not by KLM alone.
